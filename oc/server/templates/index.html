						    <span>My name's Edward A.</span>
							<p>Zhang or you can just call me Ed. I'm both founder and CEO, and the vision for our team. I'm currently 24 years old, an Economics/Accounting graduate from the University of MD, College Park, and an avid lover of all kinds of sports, but I especially love playing basketball and tennis. I am a very passionate person and owning my own company has always been a big dream of mine. I couldn't have gotten to where I am now without the guys below.  I started this company in hopes of re-creating a discussion platform on the web as something that I would personally love to use. </p>
							<h4>What does discussion mean to you?</h4>
							<p>
								I truly believe that our product is making a great cause in the world. Discussion to me is the coming together of one warm community in an exchange of ideas. In this way, it's possible to not only mutually educate and inform, but we can cultivate new and exciting ideas as well.

        <div id="faq" style="display:none">
        <ul>
            <li><div class="question">What is prestige?</div>
            <div class="answer">Prestige is a metric used to indicate your likability, popularity, and general quality of contributions. Prestige points are earned when you create posts or when your posts are up voted. When enough prestige points are earned, you increase to the next prestige level.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">How many prestige levels are there?</div>
            <div class="answer">Prestige levels are from 1 to 100. With every prestige level increase, the requirements for prestige points increases.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">What are the benefits to having high prestige?</div>
            <div class="answer">Higher exposure and popularity by being on the leader board, as well as wielding more power. Users with higher prestige have greater influence through up votes.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">Will there be new categories?</div>
            <div class="answer">Yes, depending on demand for new categories.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">What is Question of the Week?</div>
            <div class="answer">Every week an open-ended conversation topic will be chosen. These questions are meant to stimulate community and social interaction.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">What determines the Suggested Tasks?</div>
            <div class="answer">Suggested tasks are our recommendations to you based upon your viewing and posting history. Sometimes you may get recommendations from categories you frequently visit. Other times you might be encouraged to visit conversations you don’t explore often.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">When should users give a &quot;coffee&quot; up vote?</div>
            <div class="answer"> The coffee up vote is our representation of a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Our take on up voting is based on people, and not on the actual content itself. Each user can be upvoted once within each conversation. You determine which users deserve your upvote, whether they are: helpful, friendly, spontaneous, badass, or whatever else! In the future, our up vote system will be more elaborate.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">How does flagging work?</div>
            <div class="answer">You can opt to flag a post that you deem is inappropriate, spam, offensive, or bad manner in some way. When enough flags have been voted by the community, the post will shut down automatically. With every flag, the post loses transparency.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">Who are the moderators?</div>
            <div class="answer">Currently the only moderators are the co-founders. As the site expands, we will gradually add qualified moderators. Maintaining a safe and mature community means everything to us.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">Will users be able to change their avatars?</div>
            <div class="answer">Certainly. At the moment, only a limited selection is available. However, we will allow you to upload your own avatar in the near future.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">Who creates the visuals for OuterClub?</div>
            <div class="answer">They’re great, aren’t they? Our lovely graphic designer, Uliya is in charge of all the graphics. The background is photography by Rob Sheridan.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">When will OuterClub complete beta?</div>
            <div class="answer">We are busy making new additions and adjustments on a daily basis. The best answer is: when we feel that the product is finally ready with enough of our intended features. Oh, and of course when it’s bug-free.</div></li>
            <li><div class="question">What new features can we expect in the future?</div>
            <div class="answer">We have tons of stuff planned for you guys! This includes: more user customization, better real-time features, conversation facilitation mechanisms, interesting prestige/virtual goods incentives, and so much more.</div> </li>
            <li><div class="question">What are personal blurbs?</div>
            <div class="answer">A blurb is somewhere around one to two sentences in length describing how you feel about a particular category. It's purpose is to both allow you to express yourself creatively, as well as let others know how you feel about the category.</div> </li>
            <li><div class="question">How do I add my friends?</div>
            <div class="answer">Those who are current users of OuterClub will be able to invite other users to the community. This will be implemented very soon.</div> </li>
            <li><div class="question">How do groups work?</div>
            <div class="answer">At the moment, we are in the process of creating groups for your social circles. Groups will provide your mini-community a personal conversation page along with other groups features. However, no prestige can be earned for conversations within the group.</div> </li>

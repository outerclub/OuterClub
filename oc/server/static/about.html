                        <p>OuterClub runs on passion – a burning desire for a product that we, the founders would love to use. This is about the creation of something new that we can share with our users together.  We all have thought-provoking questions about life, interests and hobbies that we love, experiences and stories that we want to share. Let’s cut out all the trolling and flame wars, and broaden our minds and horizons. It’s time to meet the rest of the world and share our passions with it.</p>

						    <span>My name's Edward A.</span>
							<p>Zhang or you can just call me Ed. I'm both founder and CEO, and the vision for our team. I'm currently 24 years old, an Economics/Accounting graduate from the University of MD, College Park, and an avid lover of all kinds of sports, but I especially love playing basketball and tennis. I am a very passionate person and owning my own company has always been a big dream of mine. I couldn't have gotten to where I am now without the guys below.  I started this company in hopes of re-creating a discussion platform on the web as something that I would personally love to use. </p>
							<h4>What does discussion mean to you?</h4>
							<p>
								I truly believe that our product is making a great cause in the world. Discussion to me is the coming together of one warm community in an exchange of ideas. In this way, it's possible to not only mutually educate and inform, but we can cultivate new and exciting ideas as well.
